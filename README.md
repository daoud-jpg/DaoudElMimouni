# DaoudElMimouni
I'm a software development student at Odisee with experience in ASP.NET and Kotlin Jetpack Compose for mobile development. I also have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
I enjoy building applications, solving problems, and learning new technologies. I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and continuously improving my skills. I have worked on projects that involve both web and mobile development, applying best practices and modern frameworks.
